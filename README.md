# PyTorch

**In this Repo, I will demonstrate the usage of PyTorch in different categories of data types, namely audio, computer vision, and so on.**

## Example One: Rice Classification
In this example, I have created a script to classify different categories of rice types, there are in total 75000 different images of 5 different kind of rice. Source can be found cited in the citation document in the submodule.

After 3 epochs of batch_size=128 training and testing, I managed to bring the accuracy up to 97%, and saved the model's state dictionary in the same folder in case you want to try it out for yourself.
